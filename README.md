# HelloKoltin
I wanted to try to make an android app following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLDj-qxDKI
I saw that the vector art has a dice, so I'm making a dice roll app now.


I followed the tutorial up to this point.
Some problems and things I learned etc etc:
Vector art is not clip art.
Koltin is a whole lot like java but not really
The tutorial I followed it out of date.

Some things left to do before I call this mini-project complete:
- Make the floaty toast text or whatever bigger and fancier
- Get the dice to do different animations
- Have the picture for the dice change based on the number
- Give the app a proper name and logo
- Change the UI to look different
